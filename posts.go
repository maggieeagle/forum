var post1 string = `Howdy folks,

I'm in a bit of a pickle and was hoping someone here might be able to help. I'm a new cowboy on the range and I've managed to misplace my trusty lasso.
I've searched high and low but can't seem to find it anywhere. I feel like a cowboy without his lasso is like a bird without wings or a horse without a saddle.
If anyone has any tips or tricks for finding a lost lasso, I'm all ears. Or, if you happen to have a spare one lying around, I'd be happy to buy it off you.
I'm hoping to get back to roping and wrangling soon, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Lasso-less Cowboy`

var comment1_1 string = "Hey there, Lasso-less Cowboy! Sorry to hear about your misfortune. If you're in a real bind and need a lasso ASAP, you could always try fashioning one out of some rope or twine. It might not be as sturdy as a regular lasso, but it could tide you over until you find your missing one or can purchase a new one. Just be careful not to injure yourself or your livestock in the process. Best of luck!"
var comment1_2 string = "Howdy, Lasso-less Cowboy! As a seasoned cowboy myself, I've lost my fair share of lassos over the years. One tip I can offer is to check with any local trading posts or general stores in the area. Sometimes, other cowboys might have found a stray lasso and brought it in to sell or trade. It's always worth a shot! Happy roping."
var comment1_3 string = "Howdy there! Losing your lasso can be a real pain in the neck, especially when you're just starting out. One trick that might help is to retrace your steps from the last time you used it. Sometimes, we forget that we put things down in strange places, and we end up looking in all the wrong spots. Good luck on your search, partner!"

var post2 string = `Howdy y'all,

I just wanted to share a little bit about my trusty sheep dog, Buster. This little guy has been by my side through thick and thin on the range. He's helped me herd sheep, keep an eye on the cattle, and even chased off a few coyotes trying to sneak up on our livestock.

Buster may not be the biggest or the fastest dog out there, but he's got heart and he's a true partner in this cowboy life. I couldn't imagine doing this job without him.

For any of you cowboys and cowgirls out there who are considering getting a sheep dog of your own, I highly recommend it. They may require a bit of training, but they're worth their weight in gold when it comes to helping you manage your livestock.

Thanks for listening to me ramble on about my furry friend. I reckon I better get back to work now.

Happy trails,
Cowboy with a loyal pup by his side.`

var comment2_1 string = "Howdy Cowboy with a loyal pup by his side, thanks for sharing your story about Buster! It's always heartwarming to hear about the special bond between a cowboy and his trusty dog. I couldn't agree more that sheep dogs are a valuable asset on the range. They're not only great at herding, but they also provide companionship and security. Here's to many more happy trails with Buster by your side!"
var comment2_2 string = "Howdy partner, your story about Buster reminded me of my own loyal sheep dog, Rusty. He may not be the biggest or the fastest either, but he's got a nose for finding lost livestock and a bark that can be heard for miles. It's great to see other cowboys and cowgirls appreciate the value of having a sheep dog on the range. Keep up the good work, and give Buster a pat on the head for me!"

I'm fixin' to introduce myself as a fresh member of this here forum. I've been scannin' through some of the threads and let me tell you, it's been a hoot to see y'all talkin' 'bout ranches and pups. But, I reckon it's high time we rustle up a new conversation about somethin' else.

I'm a pretty big fan of photography and I was wonderin' if any of y'all feel the same. I'm partial to snappin' shots of landscapes and critters in their natural stompin' grounds. There's somethin' downright special 'bout capturin' a moment and savin' it forever.

Now, I'd be mighty obliged to hear from any of y'all who share this passion. What kinda camera do ya use? What sorta subjects do ya like to snap? And, do ya have any tips or tricks fer gettin' the perfect shot?

Best regards,
New member`

var comment3_1 string = "Howdy, folks! As a cowboy and a lover of photography, I reckon there ain't nothin' quite like capturing the thrill and excitement of a rodeo. I use an old Nikon F2 camera, and while it may not be as fancy as some of them newfangled models, it gets the job done just fine. There's somethin' about the way the film captures the grit and raw energy of the bulls and the cowboys that digital just can't match. So grab your gear and join me in the arena for some good old-fashioned rodeo photography!"

var post4 string = `Howdy fellas,

I'm a cowgirl on the lookout for a cowboy who can ride, rope, and wrangle with the best of them. Someone who knows the ins and outs of ranch life and can appreciate a hard day's work.

Now, I'm not just looking for any old cowboy. I want someone who's got a good head on their shoulders, a kind heart, and a strong work ethic. Someone who's not afraid to get their hands dirty and who knows how to treat a lady right.

So if you think you fit the bill, send me a message and let's see if we can hit it off. Bonus points if you know how to two-step and don't mind a little dirt on your boots.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Cowgirl on the lookout.`

var comment4_2 string = "Howdy ma'am, your post caught my eye. I reckon I fit the bill of the cowboy you're looking for. I've been riding, roping, and wrangling since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and I know how to treat a lady right. I'd love to two-step with you and show you what a real cowboy can do. Let me know if you're interested."
